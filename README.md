moodle2google
=============
This program takes an iCalendar file generated by http://sict.moodle.aau.dk
and returns a better structured iCalendar file. Only really useful for people
studying Computer Science at Aalborg University.

Online version at http://apakoh.dk/projects/moodle2google

Adding ``?debug`` to the above url will set the Content-Type to ``text/plain``
instead of ``text/calendar``.

The query-parameter ``remove`` can be used to remove events that contain one
of the specified values (``remove`` is a comma-separated list of values).
The default behaviour is to remove AD2 and DEB2. A few examples:

* Remove nothing:

    http://apakoh.dk/projects/moodle2google?remove=
    
* Remove AD2, DEB2 and SU(ENG)

    http://apakoh.dk/projects/moodle2google?remove=AD2,DEB2,SU(ENG)


An iCalendar validator (the output is valid according to this): http://severinghaus.org/projects/icv/
